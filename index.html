        For some, it takes years to discover their purpose in life. 
        For others, they know it from a very young age. 
        For me, it just took a while to put a name to it: solving interesting problems

      <p>
        In college, I started a summer landscaping 'business' in my hometown. It lead me to get a business degree at Northern Illinois University. For many students, they think getting a business degree is a good idea because it will make for a great 'career'. I liked the challenge of what I was doing during the summer, from tracking expenses and payments, to working with clients, and finding new sources of revenue. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A year or two after graduating, with a desire to see something new, I moved to Arizona, and found the two loves of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I signed on with a small business intelligence (BI) consulting company, that had a team building powerful tools, on top of a highly respected BI platform, now called SAP Business Objects. They built a tool that took the drudgery out of  peoples life by delivering reports from the BI platform.

        Though I didn't have the slightest clue how software actually worked, I quickly learned.

      <p>
        At some points, it feels like a bit of an obsession, but I'm ok with that.

        SQL Builder
      </h3>
      <p>
        For those not in the 'know', SQL is a structured language used to retrieve and update data from a database.
        There was a desire from our users to have an easy way to create these SQL statements, without having to know the language.
        The problem was that, not only would I have to 'write' the SQL for them, but I'd also have to read SQL, which is a more difficult task.
        I embarked on this task without understanding the rabbit hole I was about to go down.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        Semantic Layer
      </h3>
      <p>
        After building the basics of the SQL Builder, and understanding how to read and generate SQL, I embarked on an even more ambitious task: could I look at a whole database and generate SQL based on its structure?
        The answer turned out to be yes.

        Apparently I have high expectations to live up to.... as of recently, my great-grandfather, grandfather, and father all have their PHDs. I figured it would be fun to do some research into their impact on this world. <a href="family.html">Check it out here.</a>

        Food nourishes us and brings us together. Feeding people good food makes them happy. Happy people are fun to be around.

        So I like to make damn good food.
