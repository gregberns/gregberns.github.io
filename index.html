<h2>
Drive
</h2>
<p>
A couple years ago I discovered what drives me: solving interesting problems.
</p>
<p>
For some, it takes years to discover their purpose in life. For others, they know it from a very young age. For me, it just took a while to put a name to it.

<h2>
Work
</h2>
<p>
In college, I started a summer landscaping 'business' in my hometown. It lead me to get a business degree at Northern Illinois University. For many students, they think getting a business degree is a good idea because it will make for a great 'career'. I liked the challenge of what I was doing during the summer, from tracking expenses and payments, to working with clients, and finding new sources of revenue. 
</p>
<p>
A year or two after graduating, with a desire to see something new, I moved to Arizona, and found the two loves of my life.
</p>
<p>
I signed on with a small business intelligence (BI) consulting company, that had a team building powerful tools, on top of a highly respected BI platform, now called SAP Business Objects. They built a tool that took the drudgery out of  peoples life by delivering reports from the BI platform.
</p>
<p>
Though I didn't have the slightest clue how software actually worked, I quickly learned.
</p>
<p>
At some points, it feels like a bit of an obsession, but I'm ok with that.

<h3>
SQL Builder
<h3>
<p>
For those not in the 'know', SQL is a structured language used to retrieve and update data from a database.
There was a desire from our users to have an easy way to create these SQL statements, without having to know the language.
The problem was that, not only would I have to 'write' the SQL for them, but I'd also have to read SQL, which is a more difficult task.
I embarked on this task without understanding the rabbit hole I was about to go down.
</p>

<h3>
Semantic Layer
</h3>
<p>
After building the basics of the SQL Builder, and understanding how to read and generate SQL, I embarked on an even more ambitious task: could I look at a whole database and generate SQL based on its structure?
The answer turned out to be yes.

Family
</h2>
<p>
Apparently I have high expectations to live up to.... as of recently, my great-grandfather, grandfather, and father all have their PHDs. I figured it would be fun to do some research into their impact on this world. <a href="family.html">Check it out here.</a>
