        <h2 id="work">Background</h2>
        <p>
          In college, I started a summer landscaping business in my hometown. It lead me to get a business degree at Northern 
          Illinois University. For many students, they think getting a business degree is a good idea because it will make 
          for a great 'career'. I liked the challenge of what I was doing during the summer, from tracking expenses and 
          payments, to working with clients, and finding new sources of revenue. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A year or two after graduating, with a desire to see something new, I moved to Arizona, and found the two loves 
          of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I signed on with a small business intelligence (BI) consulting company, that had a team building powerful tools, 
          on top of a highly respected BI platform, now called SAP Business Objects. They built a tool that took the drudgery 
          out of peoples life by delivering reports to where people needed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I didn't have the slightest clue how software actually worked, I quickly learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some points, it feels like a bit of an obsession, but I'm ok with that.

            <p>Helped guide a junior developer in the building of a BI dashboard design tool. While I did help write some code,
            due to my knowledge of the domain, my primary role was to provide guidance on what to build next, testing what 
            was being built, and push for workflow/UX improvements. Over six months time, the product moved from a barebones
            design tool, to one that in many ways was more powerful than the design tool we were comparing ourselves against.</p>

        <h3>SQL Builder</h3>
          <p>
            For those not in the 'know', SQL is a structured language used to retrieve and update data from a database.
            There was a desire from our users to have an easy way to create these SQL statements, without having to know the 
            language. The problem was that, not only would I have to 'write' the SQL for them, but I'd also have to read SQL,
            which is a more difficult task. I embarked on this task without understanding the rabbit hole I was about to 
            go down.
          </p>
        
        <h3>Semantic Layer</h3>
        <p>
          After building the basics of the SQL Builder, and understanding how to read and generate SQL, 
          I embarked on an even more ambitious task: could I look at a whole database 
          and generate SQL based on its structure?
          The answer turned out to be yes.

        <h3>Languages</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>.NET - VB & C#</li>
            <li>Web - JavaScript, HTML, CSS</li>
            <li>Java</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h3>APIs & SDKs</h3>
          
          <p>Primary developer, building the interface between InfoBurst and the BI Platform. 
          Wrote both the initial BI4.0 Java interface, and later, the BI4.1 Web Service interface.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Business Objects 4.0 Web Wervice - REST based API</li>
            <li>Business Objects 4.1 Java SDK</li>
            <li>Business Objects XI3.1 Web Service and Full Client SDK's</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>BI 4.1 Web Service Challenges</h4>
          <p>The issue was, and continues to be, that the implementation of the BI4.1 REST API did not do everything we 
          needed it to do. That meant that we could not be fully backwards compatible, which would not be acceptable, 
          especially for many current customers.</p>
        
          <p>To deal with this, the implementation had to deal with not one, but three different BI4 APIs/SDKs, 
          and provide a single interface back to the InfoBurst Platform. 
          This meant the code needed to work with a REST API, a SOAP SDK, and a 'Fat Client' SDK.
          Each one needed to be tied together, so the calls from the InfoBurst platform were seamless.</p>
        
          <p>Once implemented, the new interface was deployed at client sites, and provided significant performance 
          improvements, and is now utilized at a majority of InfoBurst sites.</p>
        
          <h4>BI 4.1 Java SDK Challenges</h4>
          <p>InfoBurst is a .NET application, and when BI4.0 was released, the only interface available was a Java SDK. 
          Of course, there is no easy way to interface between a .NET and Java application.
          If we could solve this problem, we could provide our customers with a solution and help us get new customers 
          durring a time of great demand.</p>
          
          <p>Before solving this problem, we had to convert 5,000 lines of VB.NET code into Java code, 
          to ensure we could achieve what was needed through the Java SDK.</p>
          
          <p>Once we knew the functions we needed were possible, we needed to build a 'Bridge' between the .NET and Java 
          processes. To do this, a new Java process was started, which started a SOAP API. From there, the .NET application
          could start a SOAP client and send messages to the Java 'server'. Once the processing was complete on the .NET 
          side, it needed to tell the Java server to shut down and kill its own process.</p>
      
          <p>This was quite challenging to get working, but it allowed us to get 'ahead of the curve', 
          and release a version of InfoBurst that supported BI4.0 almost a year and a half before the new API was released.
          This resulted in several sales to new customers, who were moving to the new BI version.</p>
