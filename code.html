        <p>
          In college, I started a summer landscaping business in my hometown. It lead me to get a business degree at Northern Illinois University. For many students, they think getting a business degree is a good idea because it will make for a great 'career'. I liked the challenge of what I was doing during the summer, from tracking expenses and payments, to working with clients, and finding new sources of revenue.

          A year or two after graduating, with a desire to see something new, I moved to Arizona, and found the two loves of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I signed on with a small business intelligence (BI) consulting company, that had a team building powerful tools, on top of a highly respected BI platform, now called SAP Business Objects. They built a tool that took the drudgery out of  peoples life by delivering reports from the BI platform.

          Though I didn't have the slightest clue how software actually worked, I quickly learned.

        <p>
          At some points, it feels like a bit of an obsession, but I'm ok with that.

          SQL Builder
        </h3>
        <p>
          For those not in the 'know', SQL is a structured language used to retrieve and update data from a database.
          There was a desire from our users to have an easy way to create these SQL statements, without having to know the language.
          The problem was that, not only would I have to 'write' the SQL for them, but I'd also have to read SQL, which is a more difficult task.
          I embarked on this task without understanding the rabbit hole I was about to go down.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
          Semantic Layer
        </h3>
        <p>
          After building the basics of the SQL Builder, and understanding how to read and generate SQL, I embarked on an even more ambitious task: could I look at a whole database and generate SQL based on its structure?
          The answer turned out to be yes.
