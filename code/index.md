##Background

In college, I started a summer landscaping business in my hometown. It lead me to get a business degree at Northern 
Illinois University. For many students, they think getting a business degree is a good idea because it will make 
for a great 'career'. I liked the challenge of what I was doing during the summer, from tracking expenses and 
payments, to working with clients, and finding new sources of revenue. 

A year or two after graduating, with a desire to see something new, I moved to Arizona, and found the two loves 
of my life.

I signed on with a small business intelligence (BI) consulting company, that had a team building powerful tools, 
on top of a highly respected BI platform, now called SAP Business Objects. They built a tool that took the drudgery 
out of peoples life by delivering reports to where people needed them.

Though I didn't have the slightest clue how software actually worked, I quickly learned.

At some points, it feels like a bit of an obsession, but I'm ok with that.
