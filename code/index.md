##Background

In college, I started a summer landscaping business in my hometown. It lead me to get a business degree at Northern 
Illinois University. For many students, they think getting a business degree is a good idea because it will make 
for a great 'career'. I liked the challenge of what I was doing during the summer, from tracking expenses and 
payments, to working with clients, and finding new sources of revenue. 

A year or two after graduating, with a desire to see something new, I moved to Arizona, and found the two loves 
of my life.

I signed on with a small business intelligence (BI) consulting company, that had a team building powerful tools, 
on top of a highly respected BI platform, now called SAP Business Objects. They built a tool that took the drudgery 
out of peoples life by delivering reports to where people needed them.

Though I didn't have the slightest clue how software actually worked, I quickly learned.

At some points, it feels like a bit of an obsession, but I'm ok with that.


##Interesting Projects

###SQL Builder

For those not in the 'know', SQL is a structured language used to retrieve and update data from a database.
There was a desire from our users to have an easy way to create these SQL statements, without having to know the 
language. The problem was that, not only would I have to 'write' the SQL for them, but I'd also have to read SQL,
which is a more difficult task. I embarked on this task without understanding the rabbit hole I was about to 
go down.

###Semantic Layer

After building the basics of the SQL Builder, and understanding how to read and generate SQL, 
I embarked on an even more ambitious task: could I look at a whole database 
and generate SQL based on its structure?
The answer turned out to be yes.
