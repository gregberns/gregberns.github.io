Worked on a team to develop a new ‘drag-drop’ dashboard design tool, for business users to create powerful HTML dashboards, in the browser. The domain and feature set was well known and understood by the organization, but the lead developer was unfamiliar with customer needs.

When the project moved from a simple proof-of-concept to an activly developed project, oversight was needed to create a powerful tool that accomplished many of the tasks customers could do in other tools.

*Primary Responsibilities*

+ Project Management + Domain Knowledge - Helped developer identify most pressing customer needs and build functionality to deliver complete features
+ User Experience (UX) - Worked with developer to improve and refine workflows, to deliver a product that was both powerful and easy to use.
+ Testing - Provided testing of new features, and regression testing to catch breaking changes. Testing also lead to improved workflows
+ CSS Development - Improved 'look and feel' of UI

*Development Responsibilities*

+ Developed server-side APIs to allow dashboards to be saved and published
+ Learned dashboard tool's code base, and provided bug fixes and features.
