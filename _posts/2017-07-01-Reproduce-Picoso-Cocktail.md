Note: I can’t be positive, but I believe this story is where my cocktail investigations began. Very glad it happened…

Last year, we met up with our friends, Christie and Vail, at [Gallo Blanco Cafe](http://galloblancocafe.com/) in Phoenix, before they left us and moved far, far away. At that time, I’d almost always just get a decent beer, but that day happy hour drinks were cheap and looked delicious. I asked the waiter for a recommendation and his suggestion was to get the Picoso, a drink that "tastes like a spicy jolly rancher". I responded with an appropriate: "Hell Yes".

The menu’s description: Pineapple infused Corazon Repo, lime, and hint of Jalapeno — Shaken

I got the drink….and my mind was blown. A sweet pineapple base, with a kick of spiciness. I mean, is there anything better than jalapeno spice? Anything better than pineapple? Nope and nope.

But what was I supposed to do?!?! Go downtown every time I wanted this sweet and spicy bad ass deliciousness? How could I go on with life with something so delicious, so far away?

And then Vail suggested I try and reproduce the recipe myself. Oh shit! Best idea of the year! At the time I really wasn’t into cocktails and hadn’t made any at home, let alone try to reproduce a drink, based on taste alone. I had made plenty of food though, so drinks couldn’t be too hard, right?

So I quizzed the waiter and got everything he knew about the drink, and he said something like:

> _Pineapple is soaked in tequila for several days and at the end jalepenos are thrown in to give the spice._

Alright…I can work with that. A bottle of reposado tequila, a can of pineapple and some jalepenos. Split the tequila in two, add pineapple to one and jalepenos to the other. Wait a couple days.

I’m not really sure why I split them in two like that, but I’m glad I did, cause damn that jalapeno tequila was spicy as hell.

Now, the important part, how to get the proportions correct.

It took some tests…but finally I got something that seemed to work. The nice think about it was that I can control the spiciness.

**Recipe**

* 3 oz Pineapple juice
* 1oz simple syrup
* 1 oz pineapple infused tequila
* 1/4–1/2 oz jalepeno infused tequila (1/2 is quite spicy)
* 1/2 oz lime juice

Now, that is a drink. Make it. Love it.

**Recipe Improvement**

Funny enough, a couple months later, we were in California and I noticed behind the bar, they had a pineapple infused tequila. The bartender said they did two things differently:

1.  Grilled the pineapple before adding it to the tequila, to get extra flavor from the caramelization
2.  Use blanco tequila. The reposado can cover up the pineapple. And its probably a little cheaper.

Bam! That’s some dark, beautifully infused tequila. So delish. I think I’ll go make one now.
