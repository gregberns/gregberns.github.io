This year, work gave us both the Friday after Christmas and after New Years off, so I needed a project to deal with my two 4-day weekends.

Anyways, I started reading more posts on Cooking Issues and as often happens, I became enamored with Dave Arnold, and decided to get his book, ["Liquid Intelligence"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393089037/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393089037&linkCode=as2&tag=travofawand-20&linkId=GSAOJKSQHTI2OQTE).

This book is ridiculous.

I loved/love [Jeffrey Morgenthaler](https://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/)’s "[The Bar Book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/145211384X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=145211384X&linkCode=as2&tag=travofawand-20&linkId=52J7CAGO4OYKRJ6C)", because its the perfect way to get into craft cocktails, without being overwhelmed.

But "Liquid Intelligence" is to "The Bar Book", what a Masters 500 level class is to a Bachelor’s 100 level class is. LI goes into the depths of describing, on the molecular level, of what is going on.

*   The first section of the book is dedicated to shaking, stirring, building and blending of drinks
*   Several pages are spent talking about how/why a cocktail can get below 0 degrees C (and its NOT because of the freezing point of alcohol) (Read more: ["heat and entropy tug of war"](https://books.google.com/books?id=yUKAAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT118&lpg=PT118&dq=dave+arnold+heat+and+entropy+tug+of+war&source=bl&ots=QoDZQGokw0&sig=dNX4L_-EhhMee1NIIlhuuqih33Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YKGdVOGEBJK5ogSxyILICg&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=dave%20arnold%20heat%20and%20entropy%20tug%20of%20war&f=false))
*   There’s a quite lengthy chapter on carbonation, which really makes me want to get my own carbonation rig.

And so much more.

As they say, the further you explore the craft of food and drink making, the further down the rabbit hole goes. This book just made the ground disappear beneath my feet…
