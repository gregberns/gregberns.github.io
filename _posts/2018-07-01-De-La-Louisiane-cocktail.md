A couple months ago I bought a liquor called Benedictine. Most people haven’t heard of it, I hadn’t for some time, but at some point it got in my brain… and so then it happened.

Its delicious. Like delightful angels dancing on your tounge.

In any case, this is a really good cocktail… assuming you like rye. And you can skip the absinthe if you’d like but it adds a lot.

**De La Louisiane**

* 3/4 ounce rye whiskey  
* 3/4 ounce sweet vermouth  
* 3/4 ounce Benedictine  
* 3 dashes absinthe  
* 3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters

Garnish: Cherry

Stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.
