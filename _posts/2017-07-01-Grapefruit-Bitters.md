In my [revived quest](http://travelsofawanderer.blogspot.com/2014/12/on-liquid-intelligence.html) to learn more about cocktails, I ran into an article in [Imbibe Magazine](http://imbibemagazine.com/) for a [recipe for Grapefruit Bitters](http://imbibemagazine.com/Grapefruit-Bitters-Recipe). And since I have a grapefruit tree right outside my door, I figured I’d throw together the ingredients I had, and see what happens.

‘Wait’, you say… ‘What the hell are bitters’. Oh right….

Bitters started as medicines back in the 1800’s, and during Prohibition people would drink them, like kids do cough syrup today, to get drunk.

Bitters are an important ingredient in many classic cocktail recipes. Its like adding salt and pepper during cooking, a dash or two of bitters takes your drink to the next level.

A bitter is made of a high proof, neutral grain spirit (read: Everclear), and to it we add a variety of spices and flavors, then let the alcohol and spices sit to infuse the flavors.

Over the last year, I’ve collected a couple different types, and I think these are the most popular/easiest to find varieties:

*   Angostura — you can find these most anywhere…or at least big-box booze store/liquor store
*   Peychaud’s — these are my favorite
*   Fee Brothers — just got these, and they’re quite good

Anyways, I took the [recipe for Grapefruit Bitters](http://imbibemagazine.com/Grapefruit-Bitters-Recipe) and modified it to my needs. I sure as shit didn’t need 20 oz of bitters (you use them a dash at a time), I don’t have wormwood, and dandelion’s aren’t in season. So this is a result of my laziness. We’ll see how it tastes in 4 weeks.

Ingredients:

* 1 Grapefruit, peeled
* 1 Lemon, peeled
* 1 Lime, peeled
* 2 Tbsp. coriander seed
* 3 Tbsp. Minced fresh ginger
* 1 Tbsp. Mint
* 1 Tbsp. Clove
* 8oz Everclear

Instructions:

1.  Peel the citrus
1.  Add all dry ingredients to an 8 oz mason jar
1.  Add Everclear until it covers everything
1.  Add top and shake lightly to mix up the ingredients.
1.  Put jar in dark area for 3 weeks
1.  ….follow the rest of the instructions in the article…

In 4 weeks or so, we’ll see how this combo turned out. Bitters, when made, pretty much should last indefinitely. Its just liquor, remember.
