The books below ended up on this list primarily because they improved my understanding of fundamental kitchen and bar concepts. Instead of calling them cookbooks, I'd prefer to refer to them as books on the fundamentals of creating food and drink.

These books are not traditional cookbooks. They are not '101 Recipes'. Rather, these books, some with the help of a recipe, help you build new skills and techniques and understand when and where to use them

As with any craft, learning strong fundamentals are critical. Without them, the basic may be possible, but when the complexity increases, the end product will be of poor quality. The first book, Ratio, is in that position for a reason. Once you understand and can execute the fundamental cooking concepts, like how to make a stock, roux and sauce, you will be able to execute more complex skills and techniques.

It will take time and practice, but these books will change how you look at food... at least they did for me.

## Food

### Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking

Cooking is science. The art of cooking is taking ingredients and applying technique to them. If you add ingredients in the right ratios, your final results will be of significantly higher quality. In cooking, when fundamental ratios are used, they provide a base on which to build. Its science bitches.

Once you know how to make a roux (3 parts flour, 2 parts fat), you just need to add a thickening agent to get a sauce(10 parts liquid, 1 part fat). If you know how to make a sauce, when you run into a recipe like the [Best Mac and Cheese](2017-07-01-Best-Mac-and-Cheese.md), you'll see the components: Roux (flower/butter) + Thickening Agent (Milk) = The Cheese Sauce, also known as Bechamel sauce, a very traditional French Mother Sauce.

After a while, you start seeing the ratios everywhere. Once you understand how recipes are built, your fundamental understanding of cooking changes. Then one day, you can impress your significant other and throw together a meal with whatever's in the pantry. In fact, if your pantry is empty enough, and the dish good enough, they'll be so impressed, you may just get laid. So...ratios get you laid. Its science bitches. Get the book.

### On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen

Wanna test whether a chef is really a chef? Ask them about "McGee". If they don't know what you're talking about, well....you have your answer.

Harold McGee is the pimp daddy of the food science world. His book is purchased and read by every culinary student. It has been described by Alton Brown as "the Rosetta stone of the culinary world", and Daniel Boulud called it a "must for every cook who possesses an inquiring mind".

Essentially, it's a very readable encyclopedia of all things food. Bored one day? Open the book to any page and just start reading. A couple pages later, you'll realize...you now know more about the inner workings of an egg than you ever wanted to know. Your brain kind of melts a little, from the awesomeness.

If you love science, buy this now. If that's not you, then maybe hold off on this one.

### An Edge in the Kitchen: The Ultimate Guide to Kitchen Knives

I hate cooking in other peoples kitchens. Two reasons: they never have the right equipment and their knives are shit. There isn't a kitchen tool you use more than your knife. And when you work with a dull knife, your job is more difficult and more dangerous.

You need three knives in your kitchen. Maybe four. That's it. The rest of the knifes in that knife block are unneeded. Overkill. A waste of space. No, actually maybe worse.

If you want to be a skilled home cook, there is a simple test to know whether you need this book:

* Get a tomato.
* Get the knife you use the most.
* Set the knife on top of the tomato, like your going to cut it.
* Without applying ANY pressure, 'saw' back and forth. 

If the weight of the knife doesn't slice right through the tomato, you need this book.

## Cocktails

### The Bar Book: Elements of Cocktail Technique

If you enjoy cooking, and don't make your own cocktails, but do enjoy drinking them, get the The Bar Book. Along with the food revolution, there has also been a cocktail resurgence. Jeff Morganthaler has been a part of it and his book will get you started. It's the best primer on classic cocktails I've read.

Understanding the fundamentals is critical, and this covers them all in an easy to handle way. Each chapter introduces you to a new concept, and gives you a couple recipes to illustrate the ideas discussed. When reading, stop and make the drinks! Soon enough you'll be sucked right in and understand why a well made cocktail is worth it.

### Liquid Intelligence: The Art and Science of the Perfect Cocktail

If you are new to cocktails, do not get this book. Get "The Bar Book".

This book is to "The Bar Book", what a 500 level masters class is to a 100 level bachelors class.

Don't get this book until you're really ready to push yourself to learn the science behind cocktails. Once you're ready, this book will blow your mind. Dave Arnold is a scientist at heart, and his book proves it.
There are chapters on: making ice, making carbonated beverages, working with liquid nitrogen, clarifying juice, and more. This book is insanely cool and there are some wonderful cocktail science experiments that can be made.

## Actual 'Cookbooks'...With Recipes

### The Science of Good Cooking (Cook's Illustrated Cookbooks)

Don't be scared by the title. This is aimed at the beginners and 'decent' cooks out there, who want understand a little more about what they are doing and what's going on. Your mom could handle, and probably benefit, from this book.

It goes into the science of making food, without scaring the crap out of you and using big words. Its also great because you learn a lot of fundamental skills needed in the kitchen. Like Ratio, this book is a great way to learn how to make meals from scratch. Do you have some canned tomatoes, oregano, onion and garlic? (You should always have these, by the way) Then you can make an amazing pasta dish, that will knock your socks off.

### Ad Hoc at Home

If you can't name a chef that hasn't come up through, or been on the Food Network, then you won't know who Thomas Keller is.

If you are familiar with him, are pretty decent in the kitchen, and wanna seriously up your cooking game, get this book. (Oh and make sure you leave most of a day or two to make one of the recipes. You'll need it.)

If you're just getting started or can't dedicate several (5) hours to cooking, then this won't be the book for you. Instead, look at [The Science of Good Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933615982/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1933615982&linkCode=as2&tag=travofawand-20&linkId=4HDQCS2YFV3ANKXD).

If you're comfortable in the kitchen, but not familiar with any non-TV star chefs, start by learning more about Keller. He may just be the best chef in America, one of the best in the world, and has several Michelin Star restaurants to prove it. And he's a seriously nice guy with [some mad cooking chops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWLt6G85zC4).

If you dedicate some time to this book, it might just be the book that inspires you to dig deep, and really become enthralled with the art and craft of cooking.
