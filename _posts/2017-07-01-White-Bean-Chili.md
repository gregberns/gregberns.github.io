I’d like to take some of my family recipe’s and get them documented, so their easy to access. I’ve started to do this in my Evernote, but that’s not public, so when you all ask me "How’d you make that", I’ll just point you here.

So, first up, White Chili.

This is a great winter meal that’s a great alternative to the standard tomato based chili. It does take some time to make, but the left overs can be frozen and re-heated later.

Ingredients:
* 1 pound large white beans, soaked (with salt) overnight in water, drained
* 6 cups chicken broth (store bought is fine of course, but if your a real bad ass, make your own)
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 medium onions, chopped
* 1 can of beer or dry white wine
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 2 4-ounce cans chopped green chilies
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 1/4 teaspoons ground cloves
* 1/4 teaspoon cayanne pepper
* 4 cups diced cooked chicken (Also you can include sausage and/or pork chops)
* 3 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese

Optional Toppings: sour cream (not optional), cilantro, crushed tortilla chips

Steps:

1. Combine beans, chicken broth, garlic, and half of the onions in a large soup pot and bring to a boil.
1. Reduce heat and simmer until beans are very soft, 3 hours or more. Add more chicken broth if neccessary.
1. In a skillet, saute remaining onions and more garlic in oil until tender
1. Add chilies and seasonings and mix thoroughly. Add to bean mixture
1. Add chicken and continue to simmer 1 hour
1. Server topped with grated cheese and sour cream

This is what you get…
