(Notice: For those unaware…Buffalo sauce is not made with any Buffalo in it. So you vegetarians can consume without worry.)

I don’t know too many people that make Buffalo Chicken Wings at home, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a Buffalo sauce on hand at all times.

Back in college, my sauce of choice was Franks Red Hot. I’m not sure I ate a slice of pizza without it. But thankfully I moved up in the world and found Rooster Srirachha. (For those not in the know, there are many srirachha sauces, and they all have different animals associated with them, like shark. But a lot of them…well…suck.)

Anyways, though srirachha is great, it’s not a buffalo sauce. So a couple years ago I set out to make my own. It only took 10–15 tests and I had it.

Best thing about it… any college kid could make it with what they have in their fridge.

* 2 tbls Srirachha
* 2 tbls Franks Red Hot
* 1 tbls Ranch
* 1 tbls Butter

The second best thing is its really hard to forget the parts… 2 of each Red, 1 of each white.

What you get is a full bodied sauce, a spice level almost any one can handle, and a bit of sweetness.

The bad thing about it… It has almost no heat behind it, and to me, that is absolutely not acceptable.

I am working on a solution, but an easy one has not come my way yet. Crushed dried habanero helped, but getting the proper quantity and heat level will be challenging… but I’ll keep searching.
