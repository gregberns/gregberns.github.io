Next time you have to bring something to a party, instead of making your Mom’s not-so-amazing potato salad, make the wonder that is this Black Bean Salad.

**Ingredients** (Makes 4 cups)

Two 15-ounce can black beans

1 lime, juiced

1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped

2 small shallots, diced

1/2 tbsp olive oil

3/4 teaspoon ground cumin

[1/4–1/2](https://www.blogger.com/null) tsp Kosher Salt, to taste

Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1 large avocado, chopped into 1/2 inch pieces

**Instructions**

Drain the beans thoroughly and rinse. In a large bowl add the beans and toss with lime juice, cilantro leaves, diced shallot, and ground cumin. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Peel and slice an avocado, and serve the beans at room temperature, with chopped avocado on top or mixed throughout the salad. Note that I did not have any cilantro on hand, but it still tasted delicious! Makes 3–4 servings.

Notes from original recipe: The beans will last for several days in the fridge. You can easily take this salad for lunch and bring along an avocado to chop up just before serving.
