This Mac and Cheese is the best you’ve ever made at home. No, it doesn’t include breading…cause mac and cheese shouldn’t. It doesn’t take too long to make, and isn’t too hard, but is more challenging then making the orange plastic shit that comes out of the box.

Ingredients:

* 1 pack of elbow macaroni
* 1/4 cup of butter or margerine
* 1/4 cup of all purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp pepper
* 2 cups of milk
* 8 oz or more of cheddar cheese grated ( 2 cups)

Steps:

1.  Preheat oven to 375 cook macaroni as labeled on box and drain
2.  Meanwhile, melt butter in saucepan adn remove from heat. Stir in flour, salt, pepper until smooth.
3.  Gradually stir in milk. Bring to boiling, stirring continually. Reduce, heat, and simmer mixture for about 1 minute to thicken… remove from heat.
4.  Stir in 1 1/2 cups of cheese or a bit more… till melted. then pour sauce over cooked macaroni. put into greased casserole dish. Sprinkle with extra cheese.
5.  Bake 15–20 minutes or until cheese is golden brown
