There are a handful of good podcasts that I listen to consistently, some should be of general interest to most app developers, others are a bit niche.

### The Changelog

This is fantastic podcast with interviews of open source developers and the projects they’ve worked on. This is one of my favorites and its well worth listening through back episodes.

Episode Favorites: #260, 258, 225, 218, 205, 202, 201, 198, 194, 187, 168, 167, 152,

### Magic Read Along

For functional programming nerds. Its super niche and they get into some very technical FP concepts. But if you like that kind of thing, they discuss some of the current activity coming out of the FP communities and ideas they’re personally exploring.

### LambdaCast

A cast introducing functional programming and its concepts. Its worth listening from episode one. The first couple episodes were a little rough while they figured out what they were doing, but it has some fantastic discussions around functional programming.

### Functional Geekery

An interview style podcast on functional programming. There are some great, informational interviews from people in the community.

### Legacy Code Rocks

Great cast on software maintenance, focusing on the the ‘menders’ of the world (not the ‘makers’). If you’re into software craftsmanship or code quality this is for you. The show primarily revolves around interviews with industry experts.
