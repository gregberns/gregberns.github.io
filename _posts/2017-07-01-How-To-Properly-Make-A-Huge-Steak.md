I don’t eat steak very often, but I love them.

Especially when they’re 2 inch Ribeyes. (That is HUGE, if you can’t tell from the picture)

But how the hell do you make a 2-inch thick, $25 steak, without fucking it up?!?!

For that, I went to David Chang’s book: [Momofuku](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030745195X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=030745195X&linkCode=as2&tag=travofawand-20&linkId=PXBWDEUKATOLNMUI). If you’re not familiar with David Chang, check out [Mind Of A Chef](https://www.pbs.org/food/shows/the-mind-of-a-chef/) on Netflix, done by PBS, produced by Anthony Bourdain. Its an awesome show, and they actually make this massive steak in one of the episodes.

My favorite part to making this steak, is that you can summarize the steps in a text message:

Season it.

Sear it.

Roast it.

Baste it.

Rest it.

Slice it.

Eat it.

Its like poetry, for people that hate poetry and love food.

So how do you make a monster of a steak like this? Not too hard, just pay attention, and get a teammate…you’ll need some one to enjoy this with.

First things first though…

### Supplies

I’m pretty sure you can’t make a mind blowing steak without a cast iron pan. You grill people… I’m really not interested in hearing it. Cast iron is the way to go. If you don’t have on, get with the 12-inch Lodge for [$25 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JSUB/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00006JSUB&linkCode=as2&tag=travofawand-20&linkId=KEJVZDRPWCMCASWB). (If you’re hesitating, remember you spent more than that on your last beer run and this thing will last forever…so just get the damn thing.)

Once you have the pan all you need is:

*   [Morton’s Coarse Kosher Salt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GHYO44/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001GHYO44&linkCode=as2&tag=travofawand-20&linkId=MTL2JSAXJ2DORIF3), usually it comes in a rather big box(…this is the good kind of salt)
*   Grapeseed oil (Grapeseed has a super high smoke point, so you can get the pan super hot. Do not use olive oil, it has one of the lowest.)
*   A teammate with a phone/stopwatch/timer (with seconds)
*   Tongs
*   Stove and oven
*   Pepper in a pepper grinder (this is where your pepper should be coming from anyways…)
*   Butter (about half a stick per steak)
*   Thyme (a couple sprigs per steak)
*   Garlic (a couple cloves per steak)
*   Shallot (maybe a half a shallot per steak)

### Finding A Steak

Please do not pick up the pre-cut steaks from your crappy local grocery store. Either go to a real butcher, or maybe ask the butcher at Costco if they can cut you something (I’ve heard they will).

Whatever the case, for this, we’ll go on the assumption that you were able to get 1 1/2 to 2-inch thick Ribeye steak(s). With or without the bone is fine.

Costco is going to be the cheapest, and I think they’re at $17/pound, so probably $25–30 a steak. Trust me though…its worth it.

### One to Two Hours Before

There are two very important steps in preparing meat: tempering and resting.

Most people are familiar with the idea of resting a steak, after its been cooked. But tempering a steak is equally important. Tempering is the process of warming up a steak before its cooked. This means leaving the steak at room temperature for at least an hour or two before you plan on cooking it. Its especially important for a steak this large.

So, an hour or two before you want to cook it, pull the steak out of the fridge.

### Salting

Meat + Salt = Love. When you pull the steak out, you’ll want to salt it. Like Chang says: "Salt it like you’d salt a sidewalk in New York in the winter". So salt it liberally.

Once salted, rub it in. Don’t be shy, rub your meat, no one’s judging you, rub it good…you paid good money for it.

Now, let it sit…. maybe cover with plastic wrap, but let it sit on the counter, not in the fridge

### Prep-work

Make sure to get these prepped before you start the steps below…..

*   Butter — 1/2 stick — cut into slices
*   Thyme — 2–3 sprigs — leave them intact (don’t strip the leaves off)
*   Garlic — 3 cloves — peal, smash, chop
*   Shallot — 1/2 of a shallot, finely chopped

### Cooking

The following steps I’ll go through more quickly, so they’re easier to read when you’re going it.

1.  Take a paper towel and pat the steak dry. Get it very dry. Don’t wipe…pat.
2.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees F
3.  Heat the cast iron pan over high heat
4.  Add oil to lightly coat the pan (Try to not let the oil smoke, but make sure it is extremely hot)
5.  When the pan is very hot, add the steak. It should sizzle aggressively. Brown the steak. (About 2 minutes)
6.  DO NOT TOUCH THE STEAK.
7.  Do not play with the steak.
8.  Do not pretend you are a grill master.
9.  Just leave the steak alone.
10.  After about 2 minutes, the steak should easily release from the pan and should be well browned. (See image below)
11.  Flip onto second side, for another 2 minutes.
12.  Stand steak on it’s side, where there should be a fat cap, for 30 seconds.
13.  Grind black pepper on both sides of the steak.
14.  Lay steak back on the first side.
15.  Put pan into the oven. 8 minutes will get you a good medium rare (Which is great for ribeye)
16.  While steak is in the oven, get the other ingredients ready, and get a spoon.
17.  Remove pan from oven, place on burner, turn burner to low.
18.  Add butter, thyme, garlic and shallots to the pan, and tilt pan at 45 degree angle. (Just have the corner of the pan sitting on the burner)
19.  Once butter starts melting, start spooning the melted liquid over the steak (basting). Continue to do this for another 2 minutes or so.
20.  Remove the steak from the pan and place on a plate.
21.  Do not throw away the liquid in the pan, instead, put it into a bowl. This shit is GOLD!

Now the hard work is done.

Let the steak rest for 10 minutes. Do not touch it. Shhhhh…….just let it take a little nap…

Once rested, get a good knife and cutting board. If there’s a bone, cut the steak off the bone. Then slice it against the grain, into 1/2-inch-thick slabs.

Don’t forget the buttery delicious gold you saved….make sure to slather that on the steak…feel the heart attack coming.

Enjoy…
